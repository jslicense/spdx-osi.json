This package exports an array of strings. Each string is the SPDX license expression for an OSI-approved "open source" license.

# OSI-Approved Licenses Without SPDX Identifiers

A couple OSI-approved licenses do not have SPDX identifiers:

1. Free Public License 1.0.0
2. OSET Public License version 2.1

As of December of 2015, [the SPDX legal mailing list](https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/) is considering both for identification.

# Deprecated SPDX Identifiers

A couple OSI-approved licenses have both deprecated SPDX license identifiers and equivalent SPDX license expressions.

1. `WXwindows` is deprecated in favor of `GPL-2.0 WITH WxWindows-exception-3.1`
2. `eCos-2.0` is deprecated in favor of `GPL-2.0 WITH eCos-exception-2.0`

The array exported by this package includes only the SPDX license expressions for those licenses.
