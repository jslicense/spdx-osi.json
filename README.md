This package exports an array of strings. Each string is the SPDX identifier of an OSI-approved "open source" license.

See [the OSI's published list](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).

A few OSI-approved licenses do not have valid, non-deprecated SPDX identifiers:

1. Free Public License 1.0.0 (no identifier)
2. OSET Public License version 2.1 (no identifier)
3. WXwindows (deprecated)
4. eCos-2.0 (deprecated)

Both the Free Public License and the OSET Public License 2.1 have been discussed on the [SPDX legal mailing list](https://lists.spdx.org/pipermail/spdx-legal/).

Those licenses aren't included in the exported list.
